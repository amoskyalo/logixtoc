# Logixtoc System

This is a migration of the Logixtoc project to:
- [ ] Typescript
- [ ] React Query
- [ ] Next.js
- [ ] axios
- [ ] Material UI

### Why the migration?
Initially, the app was built using `React`, `TailwindCSS`, `Material UI`, and `axios` for data fetching, all written in pure `JavaScript`. We are migrating to the latest technologies to improve the developer experience. This new version will also address the responsiveness issues present in the previous version.

In the previous version, we used a package called `NextGenMUI`. While it was useful, it would hinder scalability in the future and pose a challenge for anyone unfamiliar with `NextGenMUI` working on this project. Therefore, we decided to move all datagrid and forms code into the application codebase.

Here is the old version: [Logixtoc old version](https://github.com/amoskyalo/Logixtoc-Web).
